Difference between Mutex, Counting Semaphore and Binary Semaphore
=================================================================
Watch videos in "D:\Technology\Work\RTOS Theory\1\" 5 to 7.

Mutex avoids Priority Inversion by Priority Inheritance. But, Binary Semaphore does not have this feature. Semaphores, in general, can be used for ordering the way tasks are executed, and also can be used to allow one (In which case, it is called Binary Semaphore) or more tasks to simultaneously access the Critical Section (In which case, it is called Counting Semaphore). But Mutex supports only one task to be executed at a time. Hence, the name Mutual Exclusion (Mutex). Mutex is a locking mechanism. But Semaphore is a signalling mechanism. Any process can update the Semaphore. But only the process that acquired the Mutex can update or release it. Mutex is an object. But, Semaphore is an integer data.

Boundary
========
Boundary (word size of ALU) value of memory for structure padding in 32-bit microcontroller is 4.
Boundary (word size of ALU) value of memory for structure padding in 64-bit microcontroller is 8.

Different types of Scheduling
=============================
1. Co-operative Scheduling
	First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
	Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
	Shortest Remaining Time Scheduling
	Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

2. Priority Scheduling

In-tree and Out-of-tree Modules
===============================
The modules which are already part of the Linux kernel are called In tree modules. That is approved by the kernel developers and maintainers. When you write a module separately (which is not approved and may be buggy), build and link it against the running kernel, then it's called as out of the tree module.

Static and Dynamic Modules
==========================
Static modules are those which are compiled as part of the base kernel and it is available at any time. Dynamic Modules are compiled as modules separately and loaded based on user demand. These are also called as Loadable Kernel Modules(LKM).

Tristate in Kernel Configuration
================================
Most features that can be compiled as modules also can be added to a kernel at compile time. Tristate is used to decide whether you want to compile a feature built-in (y, Static Module), as a module (m, Dynamic Module) or not at all (n).

config.txt
==========
The system configuration parameters, which would traditionally be edited and stored using a BIOS in a conventional computer, are stored instead in an optional text file named config.txt. This file is normally accessible as "/boot/config.txt".
